I release the source code to the public domain; have at it. :-)  I'm also not trying to exert any trademark rights (there are games with similar names at this point time) or patent rights (software patents are evil IMO).

For the other assets, see the references in the CREDITS file.  Some or all of those are not freely licensed for use in other projects by other people.
