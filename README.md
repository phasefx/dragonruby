# playing around with DragonRuby...

One of my first major efforts with DR, this is a match 3 game inspired by Bejeweled.  Of course I didn't want to do a straight clone, so there are some obvious differences.  I'm mostly done with this one and want to move on to other things, but I think it'd be cool to allow for piece swapping while pieces are still falling and clearing.  So maybe I'll come back to it one day.  Putting in gamepad controls would also be cool. If anyone has the itch, I welcome pull requests. :-)
