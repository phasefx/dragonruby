# just playing around with DragonRuby

More properly the DragonRuby Game Toolkit
https://dragonruby.org/

Instead of creating a separate repo for each DR project, I'm going to use a branch for each project and keep master relatively barren.

For experiment.000 and dewey-decimate, I force pushed rebased versions of those without certain game assets that were "okay for commercial use, but don't redistribute".  A bit of ambiguity in the licenses :)  You can see Dewey Decimate in action at https://phasefx.itch.io/dewey-decimate-system, and experiment.000 at https://discord.com/channels/608064116111966245/674410581326823446/725114693399740488
